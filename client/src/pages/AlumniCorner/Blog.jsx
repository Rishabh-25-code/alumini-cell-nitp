      description: "On December 9, 2018, I had an opportunity to organize a seminar on Internship at my own college, National Institute Of Technology Patna(NITP). Recently I got selected on Internshala Student Partner program, where they mailed me to organized a Seminar On Internship. At first, my reaction is, What a heck seminar! without any previous experiences....but after some time, I remember one famous quote Tomorrow's work do today, today's work now. If the moment is lost, the work be done how? and I said to my self “OKAY” Let Do This. So I just filled a form for organizing a seminar at Internshala and waited for there response after a week I got a mail with some kit, where they mention how to perform, Topics & things that should be mention on speech etc.",
